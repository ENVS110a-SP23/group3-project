**Background**

**Research Question**
Coral Reefs are critical marine biomes, both for carbon sequestration
purposes and also for general ocean health. As they are rather specific in
their ideal climate, easily disturbed by temperature and pH changes, they
are a good indicator of overall ocean health. Coral Health can be measured
in terms of the calcification rate, which is a measure of growth and
indicates the rate at which reef-building corals lay down their calcium
carbonate skeleton. Ocean acidification is a consequence of increased
carbon dioxide emissions in the atmosphere. This CO2 dissolves in the
ocean and increases ocean pH. This increased acidification may have a
negative effect on coral reefs and by extension overall ocean health and
biodiversity. The ideal pH range differs slightly depending on the
species, though it averages around 8.5.

**Hypothesis and Next Steps**
Our hypothesis is that as ocean pH increases, the calcification rate of corals will decrease. This hypothesis is based on a preliminary look-through of the data, background knowledge on ocean acidification and coral bleaching, and a general worldwide trend of coral calcification rate that has been observed in recent decades. The next steps are to clean up the data. Our data set is slightly messy, with multiple pages of data and multiple tables with various information on each page. We need to determine which data we need to use in order to answer our research question, then organize the necessary data into comprehensible columns so that it can then be easily analyzed. Once the data cleaning and organization is done, we can begin to visualize it and eventually perform statistical tests on it.
