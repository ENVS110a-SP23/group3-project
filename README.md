# Group 3: Dina Millerman, Dani Madan, Jesse Levisohn
**Background**

**Research Question**

**Hypothesis and Next Steps**
Our hypothesis is that as ocean pH increases, the calcification rate of corals will decrease. This hypothesis is based on a preliminary look-through of the data, background knowledge on ocean acidification and coral bleaching, and a general worldwide trend of coral calcification rate that has been observed in recent decades. The next steps are to clean up the data. Our data set is slightly messy, with multiple pages of data and multiple tables with various information on each page. We need to determine which data we need to use in order to answer our research question, then organize the necessary data into comprehensible columns so that it can then be easily analyzed. Once the data cleaning and organization is done, we can begin to visualize it and eventually perform statistical tests on it.
